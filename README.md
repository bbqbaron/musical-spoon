Self-teaching of [ReasonReact](https://github.com/reasonml/reason-react) by building a crude grid-based rendering engine for a stock of graph-paper D&D dungeons I scrawled by hand years ago.

#Needs (pretending for the moment that this will survive for more than a week or so)
* Making cells in (admittedly typesafe!) Reason is kind of tedious. Can we parse a dungeon yaml or lisp or something? Are there deeper Reason tricks or dark ppx magic to be used here?
* Alternate boundaries for e.g. curtains, cliffs
* Alternate backgrounds to denote e.g. water
* Icons for various common objects
* Keyboard shortcuts
